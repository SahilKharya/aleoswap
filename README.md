# LeoSwap - a Decentralised Exchange on the Aleo Blockchain

This repository contains the frontend of the project

LeoSwap is a decentralized exchange on Aleo that offers two major benefits:

Private swaps. Users swap encrypted Records for encrypted Records.
Zero slippage, no front-running. Quotes are cryptographically signed so users trade with 100% price certainty.
